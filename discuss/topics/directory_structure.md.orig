** 'dev' directory structure **
consider the following as topics of discussion with userr:
- examine the structure of working directory 'dev' and discuss
- user navigation via cli is suboptimal
- first character in name of each chjild should be unique (within 'dev')
- no directory should have more than 10 children
- if a directory has more than 10 children, restructure is to be assessed
- consider moving main project folders to a new 'projects' directory
- assist in developing a few simple rules or guidelines for directory stucture to simmplify navigation / management.
- assist in populating the file in discuss/README.md as a simple guide for future discussions.
= creat a simple template for future discussions on items in discuss/topics
