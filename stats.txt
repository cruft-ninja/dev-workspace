### System Statistics (Executive Brief)

As the **Overseer** of the `~/dev` ecosystem, I have analyzed the current state of the repository.

**1. Quantitative Metrics**
*   **Total Files Scanned:** 1211
*   **Dominant File Type:** Python scripts and compiled Python modules.
*   **Active Code:**
    *   **Python:** `projects/n_gnarly_workflow_encabulator`, `projects/t_task_runner_gui`, `projects/p_prototypes`
    *   **Shell:** `utils`, `projects/t_task_runner_gui/bash`, `projects/n_gnarly_workflow_encabulator/scripts`

**2. Structural Integrity**
*   **Context Coverage:** `gemini.md` context files are correctly placed in root and sub-projects. **(Status: HEALTHY)**
*   **Documentation:** Extensive learning logs in `registry/docs/learning`.
*   **Technical Debt:** The `search_docs_legacy.sh`, `tag_registry_search.sh`, and `text_registry_search.sh` scripts have been consolidated into a single `search.sh` script.

**3. Actionable Items**
*   The system is heavily skewed towards documentation and learning logs.
*   Active development is concentrated in `projects/n_gnarly_workflow_encabulator`, `projects/t_task_runner_gui`, and the new `projects/p_prototypes` directory.
*   The `utils` directory contains a collection of useful, and now mostly POSIX-compliant, shell scripts.
